## About Me

I am a senior at Lehigh University, pursuing a dual Bachelor of Science degree in **Chemical Engineering** and **Integrated Business and Engineering (IBE) Finance**, with a minor in **Economics**. I am part of the competitive [IBE Honors Program](https://ibe.lehigh.edu/welcome-lehighs-ibe-honors-program), where I apply a multidisciplinary approach to solving complex engineering and financial challenges.
